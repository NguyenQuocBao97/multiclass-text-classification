Since prior to 1996, Bank of America has ruined my credit. They issued a credit card to a PREVIOUSLY authorized user who had long been removed from my account by 1996. When he got his credit card statement at HIS address, it came in MY name because when he had applied for his OWN credit card, it was issued under MY account. I called them and told them to remove me from the account because I had nothing to do with the bills. In 1996, BoA promised to remove me from the account but months later, they said they would not because he would not have been eligible for the card on his own. They admitted on the phone that they had made the mistake of putting him on my account but they refused to correct the error. They prevented me from being admitted to the New York Bar which cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars in salaries, legal fees, by ruining my credit and preventing me from obtaining a mortgage, and more. My credit was ruined for YEARS, despite numerous attempts to have BoA correct this error. Many years later. XXXX XXXX changed my account form another bank to BoA and despite it being a completely new account, with all of my current information : address, email address, etc, they erroneously linked it to the account from 1996 or prior and used that email address which I had not used in over 8 years and could not log into it. I called, wrote, etc. I went into a local branch and waited HOURS while the manager supposedly corrected the error. I used the card to purchase XXXX tickets for my parents, but i could not log in to pay.

Capital One conducted credit checks when they knew that there was no real intent to finance the loan. They entered into the contract after they some how systematically discovered that another financial institution agreed to finance the vehicle under more peaceful and less stressful terms. They failed to address the ongoing dispute and complaint filed against them resulting from a previous deal that went wrong. On Sunday XXXX XXXX, XXXX a vehicle that consumers attempted to purchase was in fact repossessed because Cap One rescinded on the deal. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX Cap One agreed to finance the vehicle. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX Cap One agreed to finance a vehicle that failed to operate in Reverse ; thus faulty transmission with that vehicle. Subsequently consumers have filed complaints against CapOne and the dealership seeking to remedy, sever, and abate the contract. Furthermore seeking a clean savage Maryland Certificate of Title as result of the faulty transmission. Cap One has failed to comply. Why did Cap One agree to finance the vehicle when they knew that another source was interested. They knew that there was no real intent to finance pending a previous deal that went eerr/wrong. Why did they feel a need to tamper with the credit process when they knew that the deal would later be rescinded. Failed to notify consumers of their intent to repossess the vvehicle that they knew was no real intent of financing. Clearly there has been an improper misuse of consumers credit information. Clearly this businees is engaging in retaliatory actions ad result of pending consumer complaint. It 's not the consumers fault that XXXX XXXX sold us a vehicle with a defaulted ; failed transmission. As consumers what are we suppose to do? \n"

We were immediately denied a special forbearance, and was encourage to apply for a loan modification. Since XX/XX/XXXX we had apply & denied XXXX times and requested an appeal on the last then was denied on appeal. The reason for denied make no sense. The XXXX denial was because we did not make enough income then the XXXX time we made too much. The XXXX time we was told that our expenses were within program guideline and was restated in the appeal process. At every point of communication the representative or the negotiator would encourage us to perform short sale. We did our research and ask for a Harp option and was told we do n't quality for this program. We find out later that this servicer does not participate in the harp program. We believe that the servicer along with the investor have not intention on helping us reinstate our loan. Example at every point of contact, the servicer has stated that the order to dismiss the foreclosure was sent to the lender 's attorney on XX/XX/XXXX. The lender 's attorney has denied receiving a notice at the XXXX 's hearing to dismiss the foreclosure. When we asked the attorney if he contacted ASC or the contact the negotiator with the information we filed in court records ; he stated no. We believe that the servicer agreement with the investor entitle the servicer to retain all late fees and fee require to mitigate the investor 's loss. We believe part of the fees that the servicer retains is link to the XXXX failed loan modification. If the servicer receives any compensation from the government for processing the loan modifications then it may be a conflict of interest. Base on our failed attempts, we believe the servicer and investor had misrepresented their intents and have conspired to abuse the government home retention program as well as mortgage insurance program. We ask CFPB to step and investigate first if the servicer acted in good faith and to see if they have a similar pattern with other failed loans. Time is at an essence, we go back to court this month to determine if the lender with be granted a judgment. Do to the servicer willingness to help us before we defaulted, our credit is bad and we will be unable to get a new loan. Our goal is to keep our home. Please step in. \n"

I was employed the entire time on this program as a full time employer until XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I opened my initial claim in XXXX of XXXX and took a temporary assignment in XXXX XXXX and worked the assignment until XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I called Navy Federal to report another claim that I was not working on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and was told two weeks later that I did not qualify for the benefits due to my temporary work status and they did not cover temporary employment. I then explained that I lost my permanent job back in XXXX of XXXX, and that a claim had been submitted to use the benefits. I was told that they would open the initial claim I submitted in XX/XX/XXXX. I next received a call stating that I again was not qualified due to I needed to be unemployed for 30 days. I was told I should not have taken the temporary assignment in order to be qualified. I advised them at no time was I ever told that accepting temporary employment would disqualify me from using the benefits of the service. I was informed that It was in my disclosure and I explained to them that I was offered the service over the phone and never received any disclosure or had any program limits explained to me over the phone. I never was asked my status of employment when I was offered the service and was told that the benefit of the service was for coverage if I ever loss my full time job, death, or XXXX. At no time was I told accepting a temporary assignment that it would disqualify me to receive the benefit of the program. At that point I requested a copy of any written disclosure that may have been sent in XX/XX/XXXX as I never received one. I have not been given any disclosures regarding the program after multiple request. The company has not to date presented any documentation dating back to the time that I accepted the program for me to review or showing written acknowledgement of my consent. Additionally, I took a loan in XXXX XXXX and was offered the same program again by phone and was not asked my employment status. So it seems to me that this is a predatory practice by the credit union to have folks join by phone without offering any disclosures about program limitations. The bait and switch practice is to have unsuspecting customers pay for the program and when unfortunate circumstances arise and the program is needed it is only then that the company comes up with \" disclosure '' reasons not to provide the coverage or provide the benefits paid for. In my case, I have paid for benefits since XX/XX/XXXX until XXXX and never have received the benefit of the service when needed in XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX. I have never paid my Visa bill late, have a stellar credit rating and now as results of Navy Federal 's unfair predatory practice I am facing a late payment history, potential negative impact on my credit and possible interest rate increases. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have in good faith maintained this program to avoid having this type of situation occur. Navy Federal needs to be accountable and honor the goal of the program as it was sold to me instead of compounding an already difficult situation. The company 's attempt to refund fees for the service is insulting and a shameful attempt to exploit the desperation of my situation and a cheap alternative to not honor its obligation. It does nothing to resolve the situation for which I had already paid to ensure that if the circumstances ever arose, my exposure would be minimized. \n"

I was directed into an FHA mortgage because of my troubled credit history. I was not made aware of the up front funding fee or the annual insurance premium until days before the closing. Yes, I was provided with disclosures, whether they were provided timely I am not sure, but they were not explained to me, rather I was told I needed to sign them or the loan would be declined. \nDuring the course of the process, my lender was not transparent and was often impossible to contact to help answer routine questions. I asked several times a week when I could epxect an estimate on closing costs, I didnt receive the final GFE until 2 hours before the closing. I was quoted 4 % the entire time, I questioned why the application said 4.5 % he said it 's because he had to 'throw any rate in ' to complete the application. The night before the closing I learned this was my rate and there was nothing I could do about it. Mysteriously, an XXXX $ credit appeared on the HUD settlement statement to help offset the increased rate, but this credit went directly to the seller as he was responsible for all closing costs according to the purchase and sales. \nThe lender took well over 2 months to close this loan, which resulted in huge financial penalties to me. I stayed in my home I was renting two months longer than expected and the seller of the property lost his patience along the way and threatened to charge per diem and walk away from the deal many times creating a very stressful situation for me and my family. During the course of this, I recieved a denial letter in the mail after being told by the lender the same day that I would be closing the next week. The underwriter was mistaken, and I had to provide knowledge of rule changes in order for the bank to proceed.

We were pre-approved with another lender and wanted to go to him but we could n't do so because our deposit was spent and our seller threated to walk away if we did n't close. \nFurther, the seller was in contact with the closing attorney 's office the day of the closing making changes to the HUD up to 30 minutes before the closing, adding miscellaneous fees and costs to reduce the amount of his closing costs, without my knowledge or consent. At closing, I was asked to write a check for XXXX $ which was the additional deposit amount required when I made a change to the purchase and sales changing the purchase amount from XXXX to XXXX. I already paid this difference via check to the seller and the lender failed to request evidence of this payment prior to closing, so as a result I was forced to pay it again and told to 'ask for it back ' from the seller ( who had been so reasonable throughout. ) I could go on and on, and I 'd be happy to, but I feel that I 've provided enough information to get an inquiry started. \n"

At the end of the lease terms, I requested to continue ownership and make payments on the vehicle since the car company was no longer in business ( XXXX ). My request was refused. I surrendered the vehicle at the company 's request and continued to make payments. I fell behind on payments since I needed a vehicle to get around ( based on my location and XXXX ), I entered into another car loan agreement. When I began to remit payments on the surrendered vehicle, my payments were refused and returned electronically by my bank, as I was advised that my account had been closed and charged off. Subsequently, I was contacted by an outside collection agency regarding the balance. I made payment arrangements with the XXXX and had submitted payments as agreed. Sometime after I was sending payments, my payments were being returned to me by my bank - after contacting the outside collection agency regarding the returned payment, the XXXX advised that they no longer had my account and I needed to contact the company, Ally. I contacted XXXX, and the representative advised that they did not have access to my account since the account was closed/charged off. This left me at a disadvantage to remit payments. As a result, my credit score plummetted as XXXX and the collection agency reported that I had defaulted on my payments. I attempted to resolve the debt, but the payments continued to be refused. Recently, I have been contacted by another outside collection agency requesting a different amount from the original balance. I have requested detailed information from them including, but not limited to information on how they came up with the amount they are trying to collect, verification that the statue of limitiation has/has not expired, proof they are authorized to collect in my state, which they have not provided. They only sent a copy of the lease agreement and a statement with a different amount that they are attempting to collect. \n"

I believed what I was told and feel I was deceived so I 'd use my card. I asked for the name of the associate who activated my card/placed a travel exclusion on my card, he responded that my card could not have been recently activated ( \" must be three years ago '' ).

I was the one who discovered the card stolen by reporting it to the police. I am out $ 1600+ because by the time I discovered it, the money was n't recoverable. I 'm guilty of being an idiot, but I am not dishonest. I 'm also a VERY small business owner and in this economy I live hand-to-mouth. \n\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, my credit card processor, deducted $ 1400+ from my business checking with no warning, about a month later. That put my account into negative. My Credit Union rejected the ACH due to insufficient funds. In fact there was no indication on the ACH as to who initiated the transaction and my Credit Union had to do some research for me. \n\nI signed up for my POS/Merchant Services through a XXXX party, had no contract to sign and therefore I did not have much information to go by in order to contact them in an attempt to resolve the issue. \n\nAfter several attempts to talk to a physical person and leaving messages, I ferreted out an e-mail address and sent them XXXX explaining my wish to negotiate a payoff. I did n't at any time dispute my responsibility. It was only my wish to not be put out of business. I have an e-mail trail after negotiating a payoff that would involve them intercepting 60 % of my batches, that honestly did n't solve my problem. Plus they intercepted 100 % instead and I resorted to taking out a loan at an interest rate that 's disgustingly high in order to save my business. \n\nThey promised receipts and statements. They had to be continuously badgered for them. I did this via e-mail as I no longer trusted them to honor the agreement. I got XXXX letter half way through the process to initially notify me of my responsibility to pay the debt. Once I had paid them off, requested a statement showing that the same day I received a letter stating that I owed {$1200.00}. I called, and they assured me that my account showed a XXXX balance. Then, they suddenly ACH deposited $ 1300+ into my account. I called and e-mailed. I was verbally assured that it was being taken care of. I was notified that they 'd intercepted the required amount from batches in order to remedy this error and I have in my e-mail that the intercept would be removed from my account as I was paid off. \n\nTwo months later my bank account was ACH - $ 1400+ without warning. I spoke to my Credit Union, showed them my paper trail. They refused the transaction on my behalf and then revoked access to my account. On that day, I cancelled my account with them. Had to jump through hoops to have that confirmed and I signed up with a credit card processor that did not use XXXX XXXX and anyone affiliated with them. \n\nI received another collection letter, which I disputed, showing them my paper trail, statements and proof of payment. They continued the collections process anyhow. I have since contacted an attorney who is willing to help me without billing me thus far. He suggested a Debt Verification letter, which I have sent. After 3 weeks of silence, my account has now been referred to a collection agency and have received a call today. \n\nMy problem is that I have asked for specific answers to questions and had been assured on numerous occasions that my account showed no outstanding balance. Even on a day that I received a collection call, I called them back and the woman on the phone could not find a balance on my account. \n\nI have made every effort to pay them, have paid them and at this point I smell a rat. And even if I were inclined to throw money at it, I do n't trust paying them off again. And I ca n't afford to keep bleeding money to them either. \n"

After discovering the fraud charges, on or about XXXX XXXX, 2015, well within the 60 days allowed to report to the company, many phone calls and correspondence have been transpired between myself and FIA Card Services Customer Service for more than six months. \nACTION TAKEN : A police report has also been made for the credit card fraud to the XXXX XXXX Police Dept., as this is XXXX XXXX where I reside and where the fraud originated. Correspondence to FIA, along with copies of the statements which show the fraud charges, includes the following information : \" Please note that all of the charges marked in black 'Sharpie ' ink with a star [ *, or & gt ; ] next to them are fraudulent charges on the statement, including ANY AND ALL charges which took place in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I have not traveled to XXXX in more than ten years! Please do not transfer these charges to a new charge card that you are issuing in my name as they are pure and outright fraud, which I can only presume started at the XXXX Store XXXX. ; as you can see from my charge history, I have never spent over {$300.00} at any grocery store, and I do not shop at the XXXX XXXX. store. Please correct and remove the fraud charges pursuant to your Fraud Protection Policy of 100 % no liability to the customer once it has been reported in a timely manner. I will not be responsible for any fees, late charges, etc. that XXXX XXXX may attempt to pass along to me, as the customer. Also, pursuant to my phone conversation with your representative, this morning, please cancel this account, and do not open another card with fraud charges attached thereto. \" ONGOING : Every 2-3 months, instead of attempting to resolve this issue, FIA does the following:1 ) changes the account number on the card, 2 ) transfers the balance, 3 ) charges a late fee and interest, which continues to accrue. Instead of trying to resolve the issue with me as the consumer, FIA ignores it and sends a dunning letter telling me there is a balance due. Every month FIA continue to send a bill to me, as recently as XXXX, 2015 to include interest which accrues on the balance ; I refuse to pay until FIA reconciles ALL of the fraudulent charges against the amount that has been paid to the company for my legitimate charges. \nWhen calling the company 's customer service numbers [ below ], I am placed on hold for more than an hour at a time. \nAs of XXXX/XXXX/15, I filed a complaint with the XXXX ; that office referred me to the Dept. of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which I am utilizing to file a consumer complaint against FIA. \n"

I learned today that being told I would receive a title was a mistake, I will only be receiving the lien release letter and that 's all I need. I 'm not concerned about that mistake, but mention it because if I had n't called the bank today to say today is the last day and I still do n't have it, I would n't know I 'm not going to get a new title and I would still be waiting for it, which would impact my buyers. I 've called the bank XXXX times during XXXX about getting the required documentation for my buyers. I mailed the payoff on the XXXX, they received it on the XXXX, they posted it on the XXXX, they allow 10 business days to clear the cashiers check I sent them, they mailed the lien release letter on the XXXX, and it arrived on the XXXX. This allows 1 day to get it to my buyers, who are at work, and XXXX minutes away, and the DMV closes at XXXX, so they 're going to pay late fees. I explained this to the bank on XXXX occasions, talking to XXXX and XXXX, and then talking to XXXX supervisors on separate occasions ( XXXX and XXXX ). They all acknowledge that the process was executed by the bank without mistakes and that the end result is that the title does n't get here it time. No one would take the initiative to at least SAY that it 's a problem for the customer, they 're established process that was executed without error did n't allow the customer to get the required documentation to the buyer within the 30 days allowed by state law to avoid late fees.

They do n't like regulation, but there 's a reason for it, and this is an example. Apparently they need to have a regulation to require them to execute a process that allows the customer to receive the required documentation in time to comply with state law without having to pay penalties. \n"

We have previously been there during a trip a couple of years prior and one of my colleagues has been there many times of many years. I looked at some items to potentially purchase and decided to buy a couple of things, as did my colleagues. The invoice from the merchant was hand written and was in XXXX XXXX Dollars and then there was a section that was converted to USD. The primary owner, XXXX, who was assisting us, and many others, was back and forth in effort to help many people. We were in the store about 2-3 hours Before I agreed to purchase a pair earrings and a bracelet. However, before getting to that point, I reminder her of a pair previously purchased that are sitting in a drawer at home for which I stated, they must have had Nickel in them as I can not even wear them. What are these made of as I can not at all have Nickel in any earrings. She told me they were solid gold, no worries, nothing would be wrong. I would be fine. She went through an entire story about all the people that come to her, and how she makes stuff, etc. etc. I said I ca n't buy them if they have any Nickel as I am highly allergic. She said I only sell the best and there is no nickel. So, I based on this, bought those specific earrings. However, being in the store so long, and getting so late, I did n't realize she also charged me for a necklace, pendant, and XXXX or XXXX rings and proceeded to calculate the XXXX incorrectly and then the conversion of the XXXX to USD incorrectly on many items. I took XXXX items with me back to the store, the earrings and the bracelet as I quickly realized later that evening, after talking to my colleagues who bought things that something was n't right with the math. As i added it up several times, not only did She overcharged me by over XXXX XXXX, or over {$10000.00} USD, there were issues in at least XXXX or XXXX items conversion rates to USD for almost {$4000.00} USD. I immediately emailed her, and I attempted to call the store, to let her know of the mistake. I also emailed her to tell her I noticed the rings, the necklace, pendant were on the invoice, I do not want those items. I looked at, but did n't want them. So, the next day, many of us returned to her store. She said she had to go to bank to refund as could n't do with her credit card equipment and it takes 3+ weeks??? I filed immediate dispute. About 2 days later, my ears were completely infected. I emailed her and went back to the store to return them. She said she would, and then changed her mind. First she said because all of us were good friends, so return yes. Then she said no. We have a video showing leaving the XXXX pieces with her at her store. Have provided the video, the picture of the hand written receipt and over XXXX emails between the merchant and I to Chase Visa, as per their request. Despite all of that, and their representatives saying they were shocked, they are saying they CAN NOT HELP ME? This is clearly consumer FRAUD. 1, The merchant says she has all the jewelry ( even though she first told XXXX she did n't ), 2, I never took possession of some of jewelry that she is charging me for, 3, she also overcharged me which is why the receipt was so high, XXXX, even though the merchant attempted partial return, she did n't return the jewelry that was never accepted nor agreed by me to have in the first place. She is charging me for all the jewelry And she wants to charge me for more than the jewelry price was quoted on the invoice picture I tok and sent to her and to Chase Visa. I am being defrauded by a merchant in her attempt to keep {$14000.00} USD from me for something I do not have and have n't had, except for a few days. And I did n't have any of the other items on the invoice and the merchant XXXX Charge slip. \nXXXX/XXXX/2015 XXXX/XXXX/2015 Sale REBILL VALID XXXX \n"

I am a single mother of a 4 year old XXXX child. After the recession like most decent American 's I picked myself up and began to rebuild. I paid all my old debt, paid off my students loans, went back to school for law and am about to graduate with a XXXX. Last year when I traded in my XXXX Chrystler Seabring I was told because I did n't have any previous car loans on my credit report aside from an incomplete one that reflected so poorly I have spent the past year paying 22 % on a XXXX car that I had no choice but to buy because of the huge error on my credit report. However, the vehicle I was trading in had a XXXX year loan at 31 % that I paid off in XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX. When I called Experian to investigate it I was told that XXXX XXXX never reported my account correctly. They had an account from when I originally purchased the vehicle that stated I baught the vehicle in XXXX, missed XXXX payments, then nothing, and the status read \" unknown ''. After a month long battle I was told by XXXX XXXX that they closed my original account because of a clarical error and reopened it but XXXX number different so it never reflected. I was able to obtain my information from them but when it was Experian 's turn to apply the account they made me fight tooth and nail. XXXX XXXX said they submitted it by Experian refused to accept it until I aknowledged that they deleted the previous ( wrong ) one. Which made no sence to me. After an exhausting month of calling them both every day the account finally showed up on my report, with incorrect information that took a week to have removed. When it was finally corrected my fico score dropped XXXX points. I was told it was because I had an instalment loan that was submitted then paid off so I lost points because it no longer active. When I asked about the credit for the XXXX payments I was told I was not entitled to get those points because they entered the account wrong, so it was to late. Then again my credit score went down another XXXX points, when I called this time I was told an account was submitted ( focus group ) for the XXXX company. It was an error and removed that day but I never got my points back, I was told something else was off setting it. But I paid all of my debt off? I had nothing but good credit building. Then Just last week I received a notice my credit score went up XXXX points which was great because I NEED to trade in the vehicle! My daughters XXXX does n't fit in the one I have. The points were never issued to my account, when I asked why I was told it was a technical issue and they would put a ticket up for it. That was a week ago. I need to trade my car in and I have done all the right things and they cant seem to get their act together. I am now being told that credit is not something that we are entitled to and the lenders do n't have to report your good credit so I just have to take out more loans to raise my score. WHAT! You just told me I cant get credit for the loans I have paid and have made good of, but if I take out more you will help me? Then credit means nothing and their is no need to pay off your debt. That is the message they are sending. I need to have this addressed or I will take it to youtube and the news. Why should people work to pay off their debt if they are not going to get the credit due them by law? \n"

Is this why they felt the need to send a law firm after me? If this debt is in fact valid, I would like nothing more than to come to a fair solution for both sides.

I feel these needs to be brought to your attention for review. \n# 1 - My first concern with my HAMP loan modification Is that I was paying my Property Tax and Homeowners Insurance before starting the trial period payments. Chase added an Escrow account to my HAMP and took Escrow out of my Trial Period Payments [ TPP ]. None of this Escrow from my TPP shows up as applied funds in the History I received to check on how my funds were being applied. These funds being made to an Escrow account total {$560.00} from the XXXX XXXX 's and on XXXX XXXX only {$180.00} is being applied to Escrow. \n# 2 - When I received loan modification papers. I called XXXX XXXX, the representative which worked with me on my loan modification process. I asked about the {$1100.00} shortage that was in the cover letter with my final Loan Modification documents. This statement included in my escrow payment of {$180.00} and I would have 5 years of payments to repay the {$1100.00} shortage. XXXX said the increase was around {$20.00} ( I figured the exact amount to be {$19.00} ) or I could pay full amount. I opted to do the 60 month payment plan. \nIn XXXX XXXX, I received a letter from Chase Bank escrow department stating I was short {$1800.00} ( different from when the loan modification that just started ) there was an : o Option A : to pay the {$1800.00} shortage in full. \no Option B : pay {$31.00} over 60 months. \nI opted for Option B once again. This brought my loan up from {$870.00} to a new amount of {$940.00}. I now question whether the 60 month Escrow program can be reinitiated once it has been started. \nNow my new payment starting XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was {$68.00} more than my first payment. If I was to pay an extra {$31.00}, this figure should have brought my new payment to {$900.00}, not the figure Chase Bank came up with that was so much more. \nThen another increase starting XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to a new amount of {$950.00}. \nThe shortage again increased starting XXXX/XXXX/XXXX with a new amount of {$960.00} The letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX still showed a shortage of {$1400.00} with a new monthly payment starting XXXX/XXXX/XXXX is {$970.00} which includes {$45.00} extra for next 32 months to pay back the shortage. \nI would like your offices to be informed about XXXX 's from Chase which is more than what actually was paid by homeowner to Chase in interest. If homeowner claims what Chase is saying and the amount was really a lot less, what are the repercussion with the IRS by taking Chases figures from the XXXX that could be wrong. \n"

At this time I feel it is necessary to file this complaint and advise you of the following. Due to your company violating FCRA ( Title 15 United States Code Section 1681 ), FDCPA ( 5 U.S.C. 1692 -1692p ), and UDAPP this letter will serve as my Notice Of Intent to File Suit. Pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated, Title 22, Ch. 3, Article 1, Sections 10-30 ; Title 22, Ch. 3, XXXX 3, Sections 110-320 ; Title 15, Ch. 7, Sections 10-30 ; Title 18, Ch. 7, Article 1, Section 20 ; Administrative and Procedural Rules for Magistrate 's Court, Rules 1-19. I will be filing suit in South Carolina District XXXX Court in the amount of {$10000.00} that is to include Statutory and Actual damages incurred by myself as a result of increased APR 's as well as out right denial of credit. As we both know companies tend to wait until the suit is filed and wait until the last day before their answer is due to the court to offer settlement. I will advise you once the case is filed I will not even entertain an offer for settlement. I have already spoke with a law firm and advised them of the situation and if an agreement for settlement is not reached between myself and your company 14 calendar days from today he will be retained and take over the case in its entirety. But he will hold no settlement authority due to the disrespect your company displayed when ignoring documentation and request for validation of this fraudulent account. \nYour company listed an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$290.00} on my credit. These account were opened fraudulently and I had notified the original creditor as soon as I had seen them listed on my credit. Apparently they must have received the Fraud Affidavit and Dispute after selling it to your company. Never the less your company without mailing any documentation attempted to collect on this debt. FDCPA requires mailed documentation within 5 business days which to this day has still not been done. Now even after mailing the request for Validation of Debt and my letter of dispute for the second time back on XX/XX/XXXX I have still have not received any response or correspondence. Yet, the account is still being listed on my credit as a derogatory account thus violating FCRA and FDCPA. \nWhat I am proposing as an agreeable settlement would be your company immediately updates all three credit bureaus to remove this charge off account as well as any associated inquiries and pays me {$5000.00} payment to settle any and all violations. Payment must be made to myself at the address listed above on or before XX/XX/XXXX. Considering the cost of hiring representation in South Carolina plus the cost you would incur for my court cost and attorneys fees I believe that is a fair offer. Once a settlement is agreed to I would be willing to sign a \" Release of all claims ''. As far as contacting me in reference to this offer for resolution I am giving you permission to speak with my husband XXXX XXXX at XXXX he can also be reached by email at XXXXXXXXXXXX. If an agreement is not reached on or before XX/XX/XXXX we will move forward with the legal proceedings. \n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter, XXXX XXXX \n"

I took out these loans in XX/XX/XXXX to assist in completing my XXXX education, and sadly became extremely ill in XX/XX/XXXX, battling a serious illness. At this time, I was unable to keep up on my student loan payments ( among other debts ), while trying my best to keep finances in check while continuing to battle. While investigating my credit reports, I see the correlation of my illness to the delinquencies reported by Wells Fargo, beginning XX/XX/XXXX. You will note that prior to this year, these loans were always in excellent standing as well. We worked very hard to keep these loans from defaulting, and kept these loans under the 90 day late period at all times to prevent this. Sadly, due to the illness and lack of income, I had no choice but to pay these loans late during this time. \n\n\\It has been stated that they are having difficulty approving the deletion of the 30-day late in question on my credit report for XX/XX/XXXX, due to a \" non-bank error ''. This is both incorrect and misinformed, and the following explains why. \n\nOn countless occasions in XX/XX/XXXX, I was misinformed by Customer Service ( Wells Fargo Representatives ) that in the next 30 days they would be honoring a debit card payment system to aid me in paying my loans over the phone and prior to falling 30 days late. This occurred at least six ( 6 ) times over XX/XX/XXXX ; leading to many 30 day late reporting to my bureaus. This is, in my viewpoint, a bank error -- a bank representative repeatedly misinforming a consumer, whom was diligently trying to pay their loans on time. \n\nIn addition, as previously mentioned, the other payment methods offered to me were not viable options either, rendering it nearly impossible to pay my loan on time for this period during XX/XX/XXXX : 1 ) There was no Wells Fargo branch within XXXX miles of my residence, 2 ) Wells Fargo informed me that they could not utilize my online checking account for payment ( my only bank account at this time ), even using the routing number and account number, as the account did not come with physical checks. This occurred also on more than one occasion, and prevented me from paying my loans on time -- often leading to the need to mail in payments, which led to the payments posting late. These combined rendered it very difficult to pay my student loans prior to 30 day delinquency during the XX/XX/XXXX timeframe, in addition to blatant lies from CustAt this time, it is worth noting that my student loans with Wells Fargo have been current and in excellent standing for two ( 2 ) years now. By Wells Fargo refusing to assist me in the deletion of these 30 day late on my credit reports, there is no purpose being served other than to spite a customer in good standing, and whom was diligently trying to keep their loans current even in the face of illness and misrepresentation from Wells Fargo. \n\nWells Fargo Student Loan Customer Care repeatedly misinformed me, the consumer, stating that debit card payments \" would be available via phone within 30-60 days '' on more than one occasion -- Leading myself to assume that this would soon be a viable option, and to payments arriving late. This is Bank Error by misrepresentation. In addition, customer care often blatantly lied to me, stating that debit card payments would soon be available -- leading to further delays and delinquency.

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX from Blackhawk Network XXXX XXXX XXXX. called and left a message. T-Mobile Visa Prepaid Card product is serviced by Blackhawk Network XXXX Inc. On XXXX XXXX, I called XXXX and he asked what I used my account for. I told him that I used it recently for bill payment. He launched into a tirade about how I was breaking the law because I had used the card to make bill payments and have not made any purchases. He said I had committed a crime and could go to jail. He was not interested in what I had to say as he was focused on terrorizing me. He said that I have to make purchases on my card and that I am not allowed to make any more bill payments. He asked me several questions to verify my identity and warned that he has all my personal information in front of him and that I had better not lie to him - his tone and choice of words were that of a bully threatening his victim. I answered his questions correctly and he said that I passed the ID test and agreed to unblock my account. I was upset by his bullying, threats and baseless accusations against me, so I told him that I wanted to close my account and also to speak to a supervisor. He said there was nobody higher up than him and hung up on me. He also did not unblock my account even though he said that he would. \nI called the next day and spoke to XXXX in the same dept. I told him that XXXX had agreed to unblock my account the previous day but that my account remained blocked and asked if he could unblock it. He refused to unblock my account and behaved as XXXX had done the previous day. It was as if XXXX of them were working off the same script on how to threaten and terrorize customers who call in about blocked accounts. He made the same threats and accusations to terrorize me even when I tried to tell him about my encounter with XXXX, that I had passed the ID test and my account was to be unblocked. He said that I will have to answer to him now and that he will ask the questions, not me. He said in a threatening voice that he knows everything about me. Unlike the previous XXXX times, XXXX asked me many more questions than in the previous ID tests and asked questions that were very personal, such as the nature of my relationship with another individual, and the age of that individual. He was offensive and rude and even though I knew I answered the questions correctly, he said I failed the test. He refused to unblock my account. He also said that an IRS check that I had deposited weeks ago will be returned to IRS. He refused to say why he deemed it necessary to return a check that was deposited many weeks ago. I felt that he was retaliating against me because he revealed that he knew about my dissatisfaction with XXXX and my request for a supervisor and he implied that I was going to be sorry for my action. Even though my IRS check deposit was valid, he decided to disallow it and refused to give a reason for his action. To get my money back, I have to send XXXX documents to Blackhawk Network within XXXX hours : a picture of my T-Mobile Visa Prepaid Card, a picture of my driver 's license, a picture of my driver 's license next to my face, a picture of a utility bill showing my name and current address, and a picture showing the debit card, utility bill and driver 's license together.

Van Dyk Mortgage failed to inform us of the deadline by which we must be under contract which has caused us to be seriously damaged. XXXX XXXXXXXX, provided us with a preapproval letter XX/XX/XXXX and another one XX/XX/XXXX. In an e-mail from XXXX XXXX, she stated that our loan must close by XX/XX/XXXX because of the expiration of one of our children 's qualifying benefits on that date XX/XX/XXXX. Throughout this entire process, XXXX XXXX had indicated that the treatment of my student loans would change XX/XX/XXXX, and that we must be under contract no later than XX/XX/XXXX. We have been pursuing the purchase of a home with that time frame in mind and had no problem with being under contract as of XX/XX/XXXX, and had received an initial encouraging response on one of the properties. XXXX XXXX called us at XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, informing us that we now had to be under contract that day because the change in the treatment of student loans was occurring XX/XX/XXXX. Initially she left a voicemail, voicemail transcript or recording can be provided. She then spoke with my husband and gave him the same information. It was impossible to complete any negotiations with the holders of the notes and mortgages by the endof the day. The next day she sent us an email stating that we were approved fora mortgage for the maximum amount of {$170000.00}. The change in treatment of student loans is something that was known in the mortgage industry in XXXX of this year, and it was VanDyk 's responsibility to know this information and properly inform us. Had we known that the change would occur XX/XX/XXXX, we would have timed our negotiations to meet that date. Now we will not be able to purchase a home that is satisfactory for a family with XXXX children. We contacted another Mortgage company and they were able to preapprove us for {$150000.00}. That is a difference of XXXX. We are asking that VanDyk mortgage make up the deficiency that was due to their own error. We hired a lawyer, XXXX XXXX, to contact Vandyk Mortgage because after talking with BillVering, the branch manager, he would not contact us back as he previously promised. XXXX XXXX wrote a letter to Vandyk Mortgage, which costed us {$900.00}. Vandyk'sresponse contended that they were not in error in their failure to disclose important dates that would affect the amount of money that we could borrow. XXXX XXXX did inform us that it would take approximately $ XXXX to take this case to court. As itstands now we must find appropriate housing for our family, and we do not have the money it would take to litigate with Vandyk Mortgage. Regarding Vandyk 's response to the demand letter : The Van Dyk attorneys were concerned about our ability to pay for any mortgage, yet they approved us for {$270000.00} initially, then {$170000.00} after the FHA guidelines pertaining to student loan debt went into effect. Even when XXXX XXXX contacted me on a personal level to try to hire me as a worship leader for a church conference event, she at no time mentioned any concern for my loan or the ability for my wife and I to pay for a loan from Van Dyk mortgage.Ultimately the response letter from Van Dyk Mortgage discussed different issues that were irrelevant to what actually happened that led up to this point. They concede that they did indeedwait until XX/XX/XXXX XXXX to tell us that the rules were changing on how the FHA was going to consider student loans. They maintain that in failing to disclose important dates and asking us to be under contract by the end of business that day, within 6.5 hours, they did nothing wrong. \n"

The loan was deposited into my checking account almost immediately and I found out after the first automatic payment was taken that the payments were going to be over {$500.00} per month which I do not recall agreeing to such an outstandingly high ammount. That loan eventually led to the my checking account being closed and the beginning of a financial meltdown in my life. I originally thought of the loan as a way to consolidate debts into XXXX payment that would be less than I was paying but It turned out to be much worse.

I had a sincere desire to get something done, but at every turn it seemed like the lenders did n't really want to help me. I got excuses, from \" you did n't send in all the paperwork ( which I did multiple times ), to we lost it, to you did n't get it in on time so you 've got to start over. '' I never would have been that far behind on my loan had the banks given me what I deserved when I first asked for it. My loan originated with XXXX and was a ridiculous 9 % interest only loan, which I have been told is considered PREDATORY. After 46 months and no sign of help from Ocwen I finally had to hire a law firm to try to get me a deal and make sure Ocwen did n't just sell the house out from under me. The law firm did get me a modification, but it does n't take me out of hardship. While the lender did lower my mortgage payment, the payment is still 52 % of my gross monthly income. According to the HAMP guidelines, I was under the impression that my lender was suppose to lower my mortgage payment to between 31 % and 38 % of my income, but they did n't do that. To top it off, they have thrown a $ XXXX baloon payment onto the back of the loan. They sent an appraiser over to appraise the value of the house and he did n't even come inside. They are trying to say that my house is worth much more than it is. While there is a mansion with all the best materials that sold down the street for $ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, OR XXXX ) recently, my house is only similar to that house in square footage. Another house in the neighborhood which is a lot more comparable to mine XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX just sold for $ XXXX. According to the lender I owe them over $ 740K, but they did not reduce my balance because they are trying to say my house is worth much more than it is. While I am grateful to get anything after 4 years of going through XXXX with my lender, I have XXXX kids and simply can not afford a {$3100.00} payment on {$6000.00} in gross income. My hope is that you will investigate this matter and at the very least force my lender into giving me a fair deal so that me and my family do n't have to move. I believe they could have lowered my payment further if they were n't trying to deceptively and artificially raise the value of my home. I also believe the $ XXXX baloon payment is obnoxious and unethical. Is n't the point of these programs to give the homeowner a fair shake so they do n't have to ask for assistance again in the future? 38 % of my gross monthly income is $ XXXX/month, so how can the lender justify a {$3100.00} payment? I want to keep my home, but I also need to feed my family and pay for bills. Please help me get a fair shake with Ocwen. \n"

It was not until I received letters from the county that I was in default and notified Evergreen that they took care of the problem. \n\nSecondly, in XXXX of XXXX I received notice that there was a shortage in my escrow amount due to increased county taxes. It was noted that if I pay a lump sum XXXX {$270.00} XXXX, it would be added to Escrow and my monthly total mortgage increase would not be as much. This money was not initially allocated to escrow XXXX future interest payment I believe, but it was a while ago ) and it was not until I called them that the issue was resolved.

As a first time homebuyer this was aggravating for financial reasons. I payed the full amount of {$300.00}. At this time, I spoke with a supervisor at the call center and notified them of their continued mistakes. \n\nFourth, I just received a copy of my most recent statement ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) and it shows that {$300.00} was applied to escrow, but that my total monthly payment due is {$1400.00}, not {$1400.00}. They did not re-calculate my payments to account for my lump sum escrow shortage payment ... .for the second time. I have recently been paying {$1400.00} per month to get ahead on my loan, and instead of having {$48.00} paid as additional principal, they are only showing {$23.00}. \n\nI will be calling them tomorrow but I think the number of mistakes shows either gross negligence of their accounting department, or a scheme to gather extra money without customers noticing.

Also, XX/XX/XXXX, before I put my house up for sale, Flagstar REFUSED through the loss of my paperwork three times, to allow me to obtain a Workout for my mortgage, so I applied for HUD assistance and obtained it.

XXXX INVENTED a problem with my paperwork, lost said paperwork for a claim filed more than 2 years previously with my roof damage, and claimed I never sent them paperwork and photos, even though they approved the claim and paid me ( and then they later RENEWED my insurance without a problem -- why would they renew my insurance again if there was a problem 2 years before? ) So the this required Flagstar Bank to buy insurance they claim cost them {$3000.00} per year to cover my house during the short sale, which is added onto the closing costs, thereby reducing the HOAs and HUDs cuts further. Add to this Flagstar Bank 's refusal to cooperate with my Real Estate Team and processors, and you have the consumer taking the brunt of the Bank 's negligence after 15 months of short sale.

This is unacceptable and a regulatory violation. \n\nIf SunTrust does not immediately stop closing accounts and reversing miles already earned, I 'll notify a well-known XXXX XXXX lawfirm to pursue a class action lawsuit against SunTrust and its XXXX and XXXX individually. \n"

Because of the refinance, I have been able to more aggressively pay down my mortgage and have finally reached the magic number ; {$120000.00}. I called Wells Fargo to negotiate the terms of dropping my PMI and I was told by the representative that I was not eligible due to my home 's value.

Well 's Fargo has committing fraud by lying about the perimeters of the refinance and offering an appraisal value of a home THEY DID NOT EVEN LOOK AT.

There had been some previous fraud activity by a XXXX relative on my account, so I added extra security measures by requiring a verbal password every time changes were to be made on my accounts. The bank recently on XXXX XXXX, 2015 allowed this person to close my account, open a new account with my money, and also withdraw money. This person was also allowed to claim many of my purchases as fraud in an attempt to get more money. I found out about the incident when I tried to use my bank card to pay for parking and it was declined. I called customer service to see what the problem was, only to be told that they could not help me unless I had the fraud claim reference number ( the report which I did not file ). The bank did not follow any protocol by asking for the verbal password. Instead, I was left unable to have access to my money until I was able to go into a branch and prove my identity. After the bank verified that this was a false fraud claim, the bank still moved forward with honoring the claim. Many of the purchases, which included personal bills and other business expenses, were returned to the bank. This reversal of payment caused me to incur canceled check fees, shut-off notices, and I had to buy my XXXX back since the hosting service was XXXX of the purchases filed on the false fraud claim. I had to repay all of those bills with my own money to avoid more fees and to keep my utilities in service. Later, the bank gave me a credit of {$1300.00} which was part of the amount filed as fraud. I went into a branch to verify what the credit was for, and I was told that this was my money because the bank realized that they made a mistake. The bank ended up taking the credit back from me, leaving my account negative over {$1100.00}. The bank said that they took the credit back because they realized that I was the one who made the purchases and that they could not honor my claim. The credit was not listed as a temporary credit ( as they usually list it as temporary until they finish the investigation ). I explained to them that I was not the one who made the claim and that I was told that the credit was given to me because of the money that had already been returned to the bank from the merchants. It then became a problem with miscommunication because none of the bank 's departments understood what was going on even after I explained it to them many times. The problem is that now, I still dont have the money that the bank took from the merchants, nor do I have the credit they gave me. When the person filed the false claim, they also were allowed to withdraw cash, which the bank did not honor. So I am out of all of this money and the bank has not lost anything. They are refusing to take responsibility for their mistake. They gave this person all of my personal information including print-outs of my purchases, documentation stating the password on my account, my business contacts, and a lot of other sensitive information.

        "consumer_complaint_narrative": "Dear XXXX, In the last 9 years, my husband and I have tried to get a home modification loan on XXXX separate occasions. The first time was in 2011 when I was unemployed. At that time we were going on XXXX late payments and the loan servicing company ( IndyMac ) sent an intent to foreclose letter. We took out a loan via a family member to avoid foreclosure because I researched that other IndyMac customers had experienced that IndyMac would foreclose immediately and would never try to assist but hold up the loan modification paperwork. They had already sent someone to take pictures of our home so we knew it was only a matter of time before they would continue to the next step in the foreclosure process. \nCurrently, Ocwen is servicing the loan and again we applied for a loan modification but was denied. However, Ocwen recommended a short sale. We were informed that we were not delinquent although we communicated in an affidavit hardship letter what our fixed incomes would be when we retire and they continued to ask for more and more paperwork. We were trying to prevent a foreclosure or short sale so we were hoping they would refinance. \nTo date, we have invested XXXX of dollars in our home so we would like to keep our home as now our payments would be going more toward the principle and eventually we would be able to sell our home to at least break even and not damage our credit score. I find it extremely difficult to believe that there are no other options for individuals who could not obtain FHA loans before the housing market plummeted and were literally forced into high interest jumbo loans via XXXX and XXXX conventional/equity loans respectively. We are unable to refinance homes that are significantly under water yet the loan servicing companies have collected XXXX just in interest alone but encourage foreclose or short sale as only options, yet we have decent payment histories. \nWhat are the options for individuals who are already living pay check to pay check because of these high interest jumbo loans on properties that are significantly underwater through no fault of their own? To continue to pay a loan for a home with a significantly diminished value or risk foreclosure or short sale and the home is resold to someone else for XXXX of your loan amount are all horrible options. We would appreciate your advisement and assistance to seek a fair resolution. \n"

The processing could be viewed as likely unethical at best or PENFED FCU actions could be viewed as engaging in both unethical business and possible forms of racketeering/corrupt/RICO. \nAfter applying for a loan I was provided feedback in Good Faith Estimates and Truth documents that listed my requested mortgage terms. I also followed up with both contracts showing my mortgage requirements to provide, discussed with the PENFED FCU loan officer the required rate and signed a notice to proceed with the loan at the agreed loan interest rate of 2.75 %. I clearly communicated and received follow up from PENFED that they understood the rate required. \nThroughout the 60 day process there were many issues and errors by PENFED FCU. The one thing that was constant was the financial terms expressed both in contracts and discussions with PENFED FCU. \nMultiple documents throughout the process show the mortgage terms remained as requested. What should be reviewed as both unethical and corrupt is how PENFED FCU holds a person hostage to increase the mortgage rate at the last minute. \nMy closing was set for XXXX XXXX per contract and PENFED was fully aware. They missed this date and were to have all documents to the Closing Agent on XXXX XXXX for a XXXX XXXX closing or I faced a contract breech. \nDuring the afternoon of XXXX XXXX, PENFED FCU emailed me the final approval including my final GFE and TIL document that showed the finance terms that had existed from the start and in all communications with PENFED FCU. \nI agreed with the closing documents PENFED FCU provided on XXXX XXXX and was set for Closing on XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX at XXXX I received a call from PENFED FCU XXXX stating that my paperwork was not approved and I did not have a loan package ready to go to the closing agent.

I noted that the package had to be at the Closing agent by XXXX on XXXX XXXX so that I would not breech my contract if the closing did not happen on XXXX XXXX. \nOn the morning of XXXX XXXX Penfed FCU told me that they did not know when a review would be completed and if I wanted to complete the closing package I had to accept a higher rate. The only feedback given was my case was under review for the original loan rate that had been discussed and requested in all communication from XXXX until the phone call XXXX on XXXX XXXX. PENFED stated my only choice was to take a higher rate if I needed the package by noon and they knew I did not want to risk contract breech. PENFED also stated the rate had gone up again that morning and the interest rate was higher than what was quoted at XXXX on XXXX XXXX during the phone call. Basically PENFE confirmed the requested rate all along, had communicated it several times over the two months including the final GFE and TIL and then pushed me into a no win last minute change situation. Penfed raised the rate from 2.75 % to 3.125 % in the last hours before a closing package was required knowing I was facing a contract breech.

After that time had lapsed and no check arrived, I contacted them again and they now said it was never sent, needing \" verification of address '' which was given and verified over the phone and having been a customer for 14 years getting my statements sent to me every month they well know my address! \nI then requested it to be overnighted and they agreed and sent me a XXXX tracking number. Four days later it still was never dropped off with XXXX and when I called to ask why, Nationstar stated \" It was cancelled because it sat there too long. '' Duh!

I paid off my mortgage early this XXXX 2015 so perhaps that I am no longer a cash cow they have little interest in giving me what they owe me. I never was late or missed a single payment in fourteen years with Nationstar Mortgage either. \nIs there anything you can do to act on my behalf? This is very upsetting.

This information was given to us in an email. We completed the process of sending him all of the required paperwork. Three days before we were scheduled to close, he called with the closing date and then said the next order of business was to discuss what our interest rate would be. When we questioned him on the fact that we had agreed to the loan with the fixed rate at 3.75 %, he then went on to say that the rate had adjusted over the three week period of time that it took to get our loan approved and ready for closing. We were shocked, to say the least. He went on to tell XXXX that the 3.75 % was no longer available and that it should be 4.25 % but he would do it for 4.125 % because he felt \" bad '' that it went up so much. XXXX told him we would not do the 4.125 % and that we had agreed at 3.75 % and that 's what we wanted to close with. At this point, we had already given him {$420.00} to start the loan process with the home appraisal, and of course, went through three weeks of giving him all of our personal information in order to close on the loan. To make a long story short, we went back and forth many times over many, many weeks. During that time, we were able to secure another loan at 3.75 % ( which XXXX XXXX had told us was impossible ), and also learned during the XXXX process that the rates never had gone up to the 4.25 % and that more than likely it was a type of bait and switch scheme. We had to, of course, pay the new bank another appraisal fee and had to go through another whole house appraisal within 30 thirty days of the initial XXXX, and could not use the appraisal that we had done with United Mortgage because of the new government stipulations and regulations on home refinancing. We also want to note that during the weeks of back and forth with XXXX XXXX from United Mortgage, XXXX asked him multiple times to speak to his manager, which was always met with a \" no, '' and that there was \" no one here for you to talk to besides me. '' We were lied to, a lot of our time was wasted, and we are nervous about our personal information being used inappropriately. At very least we would like to recoup the {$420.00} appraisal fee from United Mortgage Corporation. \n"

This caused my checking account to become negative and resulted in overdraft fees for several other purchases. This also resulted in my family, including XXXX children, to be without money for living expenses until our next pay period. I contacted CashNet USA the first time on XXXX XXXX and was told that yes, the payment was taken incorrectly and it would be reversed. This process would take 24-48 hours. I waited for the deposit into my account, in the meantime taking out additional funding from my line of credit to cover living expenses while my account what negative. After 48 hours I contacted CashNet USA again, and this time was told that the 48 hour period is for them to enter the reversal but it would not hit my account for 3 - 5 business days. Again, I waited for the deposit to my account. I was told by the associate on the phone that I had an additional {$200.00} available in credit and then went online and requested that funding so that I would have additional money for living expenses. I called several days in a row to check the status of the reversal and was told that it had been processed but would have to wait for the 5 days before it would be deposited in my account. After the 5 days had passed and there was still no deposit, I contacted CashNet USA on XXXX XXXX and was then told that the reversal had been cancelled because I had requested the additional {$200.00} in funding, which was only available on my account because of the payment that was incorrectly charged. At this time I explained to the associate that I only took the {$200.00} because my account had been overdrawn by CashNet USA when they took an unauthorized payment from my account. The associate spoke with a manager and informed me that they had made a {$50.00} credit on my account instead of reversing the payment. I explained that the credit was not sufficient and I wanted restitution for the unauthorized payment. After holding for several minutes I was told that the manager was going to override the cancellation of the payment reversal and ensure that the reversal would be completed. I was told this would be deposited back into my account within 24-48 hours. I confirmed that I would not have to wait another 3-5 days for the deposit. After another 48 hour waiting period, I still had not received the deposit from the payment reversal. I contacted CashNet USA again and was told that mgmt. cancelled the reversal and they would not refund the payment since I had taken the {$200.00} advance.

This letter is to explain my recent financial difficulty with paying my mortgage. It started 2013 when I learned my mortgage was increased from {$700.00} to {$1900.00} which is a significant increase. \nThis was done without any notice that an increase was going to occur. This caused late payments associated with late fees to my account. I have to mention that I have not received the kind of assistance with saving my home I deserve. I was n't provide all the information regarding loan modification, debt forgiveness, or short refinance which would have certainly taken my loan from inflated to XXXX more manageable within the fair market value of my home. During the time I considered a short sale your on appraiser listed the value of the property as {$80000.00} when I owe at least {$200000.00}. Being that I currently reside in the home it would make more sense to work a person living there than to have it vacant. It seems that there has been a personal attack against me and discriminatory practices by Caliber against XXXX XXXX citizens. When I was in court going through the chapter XXXX deposition a young XXXX female explained to the court recorder that she was forced to surrender her property which was secured by a loan from your Caliber Home Loans as a condition of her bankruptcy. I 'm also aware that a class action lawsuit was filed against Caliber Home Loans Mortgage which has been and still is associated with my account. \nI am seeking Loan Forgiveness, or a mortgage that is in proper standings with a fair market value of my home. As with many people today, it is difficult to maintain a reasonable standard of economic viability when dealing with predatory lenders. \n\nAs recently as the last two months they have been negligent with responding to inquiries from XXXX XXXX / XXXX ( XXXXXXXXXXXX ).

The terms are for a 30 year fixed mortgage at a 4.75 % interest rate. My husband, who was a joint owner of the home and my co-borrower, died on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I was the executor and sole beneficiary of his estate. As executor, I made the required notification to BOA and provided the information necessary to have the mortgage existing since XXXX changed to my name without any modification in terms XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. That mortgage continues in effect. \nI responded to a solicitation from Bank of America , N.A . that was included in my monthly mortgage statement which suggested that I \" may be able to refinance and lower [ my ] monthly mortgage payments. '' Although I had already begun the process of refinancing to modify my existing mortgage terms with an independent mortgage broker to take advantage of then existing lower interest rates to improve cash outflow, I called the number on the solicitation on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and discussed a loan refinance of my current BOA mortgage with XXXX XXXX XXXX, Sr. Loan Officer with BOA , NMLS # XXXX. \nShe was able to access my current loan information with BOA and offered to lock in the rate for a refinance loan application at 4 % and no escrow, the same terms as my current loan except for the lower interest rate. Based on her representations and estimated closing costs quoted, I agreed to lock the rate at that phone call which XXXX XXXX memorialized in an email on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I had to provide XXXX XXXX with a statement that the activity on my credit report was due to the other mortgage broker contact, that I incurred no obligation with that effort as well as other multiple requirements for information within XXXX hours. XXXX XXXX also took my credit card number to charge for the appraisal ( {$450.00} ) which she ordered and took place on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX but did not tell me I was also going to be charged {$15.00} for the credit report she obtained while talking with me. \nXXXX XXXX caused a Good Faith Estimate ( GFE ) dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to issue as well as numerous other documents relating to the loan application. The GFE and other documents were not received by me until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, after the appraisal ordered by BOA and charged to my XXXX card took place. The GFE she provide was inaccurate. Although she confirmed to me by e-mail on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX that there would be no escrow, the box was checked \" yes '' that there would be an escrow for the loan with a corresponding increase in the representation of funds that would be needed at closing. \nBecause of:1. The mistake reflected on that GFE causing the loan product itself to materially change,2. Documents were altered by or at the direction of BOA and submitted to the IRS,3. Wild fluctuations in the amounts reflected as due from me at closing without explanation, and4. New information requests made as late as XXXX/XXXX/XXXX after the loan processor represented that my refinance loan had already been approved on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX -- I ended this loan refinance application process on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. \nBank of America and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, engaged in a continuing pattern of RESPA practices ( primarily regarding the GFE ) which resulted in multiple misrepresentations regarding a loan refinance. These companies also altered documents in the mortgage loan process which caused a flag to be placed on my account with the IRS effectively closing my opportunity for shopping elsewhere for refinance of my mortgage currently held with Bank of America. \n"

Because of this I notified Enhanced Recovery that I was disputing this account and that under the F.D.C.P.A. they had 30 days to provide validation of the debt as well as itemization on the charges.

I would ask that Equifax investigate and re-add these missing trade lines to my credit report, since they are younger than the 10-year reporting threshold. \n"

Thus I am in a strange and very unfair predicament where they are taking collection actions against me, including a threat to report the delinquent status to the major credit bureaus, but I have no access to the loan details!

Specifically in this situation, I had written a check to a merchant who then only submitted it to his bank several weeks later. Because I was n't expecting it several weeks later, check # XXXX bounced on XXXX and again on XXXX. I take issue with the timing in which I was notified by electronic banking because both charges showed up on the same morning of XXXX. If the first attempt had been apparent on electronic banking in sequence, I would have been able to cover the amount and prevent the second bounced check from occurring. In other words, I find it strange that both attempts of cashing the check became evident at the same time on my electronic banking. It means the bank is being inconsistent in its timing of presenting information to customers via electronic banking, and this peculiar timing ends up making the bank a profit as a consequence. Moreover, these XXXX fees totaling {$70.00} resulted in a third check, # XXXX written for {$75.00}, to bounce as well. As it stands now, I have XXXX bank fees totaling {$100.00}, and my daughter may lose her spot in the after school program as a result of the check being insufficient. For one of the largest banks in the country that gambled with my hard-earned tax money, subsequently blundered, and then was bailed out, one hopes it would be more lenient in dealing with customers ' relatively minuscule mistakes. I sincerely hope that XXXX XXXX becomes President of the USA and breaks these \" much bigger than before '' banks up into smaller businesses that know how to act more fiscally and socially responsible. As far as resolution to this matter, I am interested to know the names of the banks who submitted these checks through my account. For if it was Bank of America itself, then we have a serious conflict of interest. Next, I want to know when they were submitted to BOA exactly. For I want to be sure the bank did not predatorily wait for a moment when no funds were available in my account to put the checks through or time them sequentially in such a way to cause my overdraft. In addition, I 'd like for BOA to lower the maximum fee they charge for NSF transactions to {$25.00}. Lastly, I 'd really appreciate at least a partial return of the fees charged to my account since I 've been banking with BOA. Since {$35.00} - {$25.00} is equal to {$10.00}, I 'd appreciate {$10.00} for every fee over the years. Lastly, I 'd like a thank you for bailing it 's \" too big to fail '' XXXX out of complete destruction and for not prosecuting anyone on its board for treason against all Americans back in 2008. \n"

After several attempts to get information, I finally just looked up the required documentation on their website. I completed the forms and submitted everything that was required directly through their website. I called the next day to make sure they were recieved and was told they were. The servicer was showing that we had entered a consent judgement which we had not. They had initially refused to process any loan workouts due to the consent judgement. The gentleman I spoke with indicated that he had the consent judgment closed out and had a loan modifcation opened for our account. I was told to just show up for trial and tell the judge that we were working on a loan modification, that there was a miscommunication with the servicer and their attorney re the consent judgment but that we were working on the modification now. THIS is not how it works. A judge isnt going to listen to me. Their legal team needs to take care of that considering THEY are the ones bringing the complaint. I was asked to submit copies of my XXXX and XXXX tax returns within the next few days to the servicer for the loan modification which I did. I called back today to make sure the documents were received. They were. However, I was advised to call the banks attorney to have them cancel the trial date. Again, the servicer needs to call their OWN attorney. Their attorney is not going to listen to me. The servicer is the one directing the foreclosure, NOT ME. I decided against calling the servicers attorney since I myself have an attorney and would not be allowed to speak with servicers attorney anyway. I called SPS again this afternoon and was told that MY attorney needs to call theirs to have the trial date cancelled. I told her they needed to direct their own attorney. I told the agent that I was aware of a federal regulation indicating they were supposed to postpone this trial date if we had a loan modification in progress and offered to give her the information. The agent indicated that she was unaware of any such law and put me on hold to ask her supervisor. She came back and advised that neither of them had ever heard of that law and that I needed to have my attorney call theirs. She stated even if she transferred me to someone else at SPS, they would tell me \" hands down that your attorney needs to contact our attorney. '' Again, I am insanely confused how my attorney is going to make them stop a trial date considering they are working for the servicer! In addition, she stated that they did NOT have a modification open on our account, even though I was told last week that they had opened the modification request ( and the agent had asked me to submit my tax returns ). Today, I was advised that they couldnt process a modification until they had all the paperwork. I advised that I had submitted docs last week and then the tax returns today, no one has asked me for any other documents. She did see all the docs but that they couldnt process the modification request until all the documents were received. I asked what documents were needed and she stated she couldnt tell me that, that the file had to be reviewed first. I am so confused. I am simply trying to work this out and the servicer is telling me many different things and refusing to work with me or postpone their trial date. \n"

Per a reading of the terms and conditions on the statement, payments are posted first to the higher interest balances and then the excess to the promotional balances. For the statement ending XXXX/XXXX/2016 I had a promotional balance of {$760.00} ( expiring XXXX/XXXX/16 ) and a non promotional balance of {$600.00}. I sent in a payment of {$670.00} on the due date. The a portion of the payment was correctly applied with {$600.00} against the non-promotional balance, however the excess of {$65.00} was applied against yet unbilled non-promotional balances. Under this application, if a consumer is using the card for purchases during a billing cycle, it becomes nearly impossible to payoff the promotional balance. A reasonable individual would understand and expect that if he pays off the entire non-promotional balance and sends additional funds, that these additional funds would be applied towards the promotional balance. \n\nBarclay customer service explained that this is not how it is handled as the yet unbilled non-promotional charges COULD be subject to a higher interest rate than the promotional balances, thus they are paid first, to protect the customer. In reality, this does not protect the customer but creates a scenario when the customer 's promotional balances does not decrease over time and the entire promotional balance must be paid in the final two months in order to avoid paying all of the accrued, yet unbilled finance charges associated with the promotional balances. \nWhile this could be argued is in keeping with the disclosures, it is both morally and ethically deceptive. \n"

It appears that they are using tactics that may be violating consumer protection law in debt collection practices depriving consumers of their rights to dispute. \n\n1 In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from the above company, The next day, I contacted their offices as instructed -- the memo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instruct me to contact the plaintiff attorney, not the court. I followed the instructions provided and contacted the plaintiff attorney by phone and also faxed a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX disputing the debt ( see letter ). \n\n2. The company responded with a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by sending me a bill with a due date for XXXX. I had requested a bill showing what my balance was back when I made a payment back in XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. I was disputing the amount owed, disputing the charges. \n\n3. I wrote back to the company and faxed another dispute letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX continue to dispute the amount owed. \n\n4.

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- I sent another letter to the company disputing the balance and requesting the documents again. \n\nThe company never responded to my XXXX XXXX letter, they since had not communication with me, until XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received a letter from them with a copy of a DEFAULT judgment that they filed the court clerk 's office indicating that I failed to respond to their judgment. \n\nFacts:1. The only judgment that the above firm served me with was the original judgment which I am attaching dispute letters showing that I RESPONDED as instructed to their office on XXXX different occasions. \n2. The plaintiff failed to respond to my dispute and furnish the information provided-and was probably unable to obtain proof of the original of the debt3. Instead of using credible legal procedure to settle the debts, they utilized unfaithful and dirty tactics, violated my rights. \n4. Went to the court, committed perjury under the law by filing false documents with the court that I defaulted on the judgment and failed to respond when in fact I responded and they failed to furnish proof. \n5. I went the court house and the clerk 's office, I was told that the company did not notify their offices that they had been in contact with me, instead they the company told the court and clerk 's office that I did not respond to their summons the the clerks office granted them the default judgement based on their false information that I did not respond to their summons. They filed a false affirmation with the clerk 's office. \n"

I called the bank right away around XXXX XXXX at the same date to report this. On XXXX when I got more detail about the transactions I called XXXX because the money were sent to someone named XXXX XXXX at XXXX. XXXX 's fraud department manager XXXX was able to find the transactions and found XXXX XXXX ' XXXX account was involved with fraudulent activities. Here is the direct quote from his letter to USAA ( I also can provide the whole letter if needed ) '' We investigated the transactions and found that the transactions were initiated by someone who had access to XXXX XXXX 's online banking. The XXXX Account that received these funds has been confirmed to be engaged in malicious activity, resulting in a permanent restriction of our services to them. I can also confirm that there are no apparent ties in between XXXX XXXX and the XXXX Account Holder that received these funds, meaning that it is highly unlikely this is a case of collusion. '' However, USAA called me back eventually and told me this is a scam. And if they ca n't retrieve money from XXXX, we were held liable for the loss. They said I am liable because I authorized these transactions. I asked how you can show I authorized the transactions such as which device they were initiated from but they could n't provide me with an answer. So I was accused of stealing money from my own account and they ca n't provide me any proof. Thus they used this to deny to reimburse me back. I request an appeal but they said the case was already reviewed twice and they refused to look into again. Therefore I am bringing this to legal actions. I feel this is the only resort left to get my money back. \nI am also filing wrongful accusation, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and incompetence against USAA based on the grounds below : 1 ) USAA accused me I was trying to scam money from my own account but at the same time they refused to show me any proof. ( Phone conversations happened XXXX around XXXX ). 2 ) USAA would n't do anything to stop further loss when I reported the unauthorized transactions. I have to request to transfer the money out and block my online access so the criminal ca n't continue to access my account. And they still keep my account 3 ) The investigation was not done thoroughly. They never contacted me or XXXX for any questions during the investigation. I contacted XXXX myself and they pin pointed the fraudulent activities. I also confirmed with XXXX that USAA never contacted them in regard of this. I was called XXXX ( XXXX ) by investigator XXXX from USAA saying that she just started the investigation and she left that day around XXXX. The next business day around XXXX in the morning she called me and saying the investigation was done and I was liable. They also told me they were trying to retrieve money from XXXX but nothing was done. The bank 's mobile app had security flaws and I believe this could cause someone stole my information and money without my acknowledgment. I have detailed proof on this and I can show upon further request. I reported this problem to USAA and they told me they were going to look into it but I never hear anything back after that. 4 ) Each time I called USAA I got transferred at least XXXX XXXX XXXX times and I still ca n't reach to the right person. The reps on the phone were contradicting each other each time I called. They also told me I should get a result with in 48hours but I was called the XXXX time after 53 hours that they just started the investigation.

In XX/XX/XXXX we refinanced our mortgage with Bank of America to a Home Equity Line of Credit ( HELOC ) with the following terms : the first 10 years were interest only and then a XXXX period of interest and principle would start. We refinanced this way so that we could access equity in the home for a new business my husband was starting. We intended to refinance the loan before the 10 year draw date had expired. In XXXX XXXX we were notified by Bank of America that the loan was going to convert from the draw period to the repayment period in 1 year and that the mortgage payments would increase from {$2000.00} ( interest only ) to {$8000.00} ( interest and principle ). They stated in the letter that if we could not make the {$8000.00} payment, we could apply for a home loan modification. Since we had intended to refinance anyway we began that process XX/XX/XXXX but we were unsuccessful because we found out that our property value had decreased by {$350000.00}. So we started the home loan modification process with Bank of America. Unfortunately, Bank of America has you work with a frontline representative who relays messages from the Underwriter who evaluates your financial information for the home loan modification. It took 3 months to get information entered and resolved when a 30 minute discussion would have resolved any additional document requests and questions. Documents were \" not received '', questions were re-asked on a number of calls, we spoke with at least XXXX frontline representatives since they can all assist each other so many times I was speaking with someone unfamiliar with our case. Needless to say, we were not approved for a home loan modification but we were approved for a short sale of the property. We were not approved for a home loan modification for XXXX reasons : we are currently not in default and therefore do n't qualify for some of the programs and we have insufficient income for the remaining programs. Bank of America gives you the option of appealing the decision within 30 days of the date of the result letter. Our letter dated XXXX XXXX, does n't arrive until XXXX XXXX. I did call to find out about appealing the decision and actually spoke with someone that could converse on our qualifications. We found out that they did not include income my husband receives from XXXX of the businesses because we could not provide a quarterly balance sheet. I was then told that I would have to reapply for the home loan modification in order for them to consider new income. But, of course, the new mortgage payment of {$8000.00} would be used instead of the {$2000.00} payment in the original application. We also disagreed on how they calculated our monthly income as well. We did go ahead to file an appeal and are now waiting to get that process going with a whole new set of representatives. This has just been a very frustrating process and it certainly seems evident that Bank of America has no wish to do any sort of home loan medication. It makes no sense to not work with a customer who is and has always been paying on time. And certainly for us to continue to make {$8000.00} mortgage payments will drive us into default but it is so obvious that this is completely needless. \n"

This is simply not true, I have paid you the same amount for over 6 years, every month, always on time. This is easy to see in the attacked payment history that covers the entire time that your representatives would send me. I do have ALL of my payments and bills that I can produce if necessary, though my time doing that would be billable. \nXX/XX/XXXX, I inquired with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) to see if I qualified for a restructuring of my load to reduce my interest rates and payments. I was very vocal that I did not want anything with my existing loan to change without my permission. It appears that you did not pay any attention to me and sometime XX/XX/XXXX, without my permission you decided to start requiring escrow from me, which I have never paid. I make all my insurance and tax payments myself. It should be noted that they have always been paid on time and in full. \nXX/XX/XXXX, XXXX sent me a restructured loan packet with a HIGHER interest rate and higher payments. This was unacceptable and I declined it, instructing you NOT to change my existing loan again. I have to instruct you verbally and in writing numerous times before you stopped pestering me about it. However, as noted above, not only did you add escrow to my account, but you did not notify me. You then began sending me notices that my payments were not sufficient and all my payments were going into suspense. I made numerous calls and wrote numerous letters trying to straighten this out. XXXX was very uncooperative and rude on many occasions, refusing to transfer me to managers when I requested. I sent written notice to stop collecting esc row and not to make any payments. However, you still made a payment to my insurance company, even though I was paying them monthly. I had to take my own time to recoup this mistaken payment that you made and returned it to you in an effort to straighten out the escrow issue. All of this should be in your records. \nThe above is a brief summary of what has transpired and attached are records of my payments, on time and for the full principle and interest. I want you to do the following : I want remove the \" Late Payment '' on my credit history and with all credit reporting institution post haste. This would be the \" account 30 days past due on XX/XX/XXXX. I made the same payments as always and the escrow was in dispute. \n"

I was not prepared for this as I have not lived here in over 10 years. In order to resolve that issue some bills where not paid on time .. which would include the credit card for which I have the complaint with. My account is up to date and even though my payment was late it was not 30-60 days past due which is what they reported on my credit which had a very significant impact and I am currently trying to improve my credit in order to be able to buy a home. When I called them to discuss this and requested that they show me a courtesy of removing the delinquency from my credit as my account was paid and is up to date and this was the only instance for which I was late, as I always pay before my due date. I was told that they can not remove the delinquency from my report as they have no way of reversing the report they submit to the credit bureaus. I informed them that I have spoke with the credit bureaus and know that they can electronically respond to my dispute I made with them the previous day and the credit bureau stated once they receive that response it will up date immediately so if I need it removed soon to contact the company directly. So again the agent continues to repeat annoyingly over and over we can not change what we submitted unless we made the error. They proceeded to tell me if I had a dispute I would have to file it with them personally in writing and mail it to their dispute center and wait for them to review and make a decision which will take 30-60 days maybe up to 90 days. I kept explaining that their negative report affected me within a minute of them reporting it and can just as easily reverse it, if they would be willing to extend me that courtesy, however, they would not. I asked for another supervisor as the one I was talking to kept talking over me and saying the same thing over and over, she then placed me on hold for 15 minutes when another woman came on the line I explained the situation yet again. She stated well since you admitted to being a little late there was no error on our part, I said a little late is not 30-60 days delinquent but irregardless I was simply asking for a one time courtesy since I have never had a late payment ever and as a matter of fact they were always paid early. She agreed that this has never happened before on my account but still continued telling me that I would now need to submit my complaint in writing and mail it to them, even after I told her that I filed a dispute with the credit reporting agency and all they need to do is respond. When I mentioned I was filing a complaint with CFPB she then stated now I have to transfer you to the president line and immediately did so, and where I got a voicemail asking me to leave a name and number and a brief description of the issue. I only have 2 weeks before I loose the opportunity to refinance my vehicle from 12.99 % to 1 % and they are the only thing holding that up and the smallest account I have and giving me the biggest issue. \n"

Neither my wife nor I were able to obtain employment at that time. And access to any unemployment benefits had lapsed. The bank 's actions ( or lack of ) to obtain a loan modification or seek financial assistance has only made our financial situation worse -- and more stressful on the family. \n\nWe have literally spent hundreds of hours of filling out forms, collecting statements and faxing XXXX-plus pages of documentation to them at a time. It felt at times as if the bank was attempting to coerce us to short-sell and play on one 's own fears during times of great stress. Phone conversations with bank staff show a pattern of negative suggestive type statements rather pursuing a constructive plan of action and possibilities. Questions by bank staff were asked in a manner as to not divulge options readily. For example, questions about our intent to sell the house or confidence in finding work, were carefully asked before any mention of the loan modification program was made. \n\nOur inability to move forwarded after 2-years with a loan modification, even after several petitions, raises into question the bank 's intent of genuinely completing a loan modification -- even though it 's associated with a Federal HAMP program. Even after showing a full rebound in income in XXXX and obtaining a full-time professional position in XXXX with a large multi-national company, the bank 's actions have not changed. \n\nThe bank 's actions have only changed upon contacting our state 's Attorney General and one our Senator 's for assistant. This included having the bank stop the robo-phone collection calls, calling from unrecognized phone numbers, claiming to lost or not have received the paperwork, not willing to correspond via email as the process evolved and more. Or, when the town considered placing a lien on the property for real estate taxes has the bank ever disbursed funds of any kind. If the town placed a lien of the property it takes precedence over the bank 's debt claims We have provided the bank with an extensive amount of personal information through the submission of bank statements in full. It is possible, for example, to assess our family 's medical care activity by scrubbing these bank statements. In return, the bank has provided no information in regards to a proposal of any kind or even articulating the financial concerns they may have. \n\nInstead, the bank has returned our checks when attempting to make a payment. The claim being they will not accept payment unless it is of the amount specified. Which is impractical upon initially regaining employment and beginning to financially recover. At this time our mortgage payments are not accepted and the loan modification process is beginning again -- for the sixth-plus time. This unfortunately goes against our credit and falsely creates the appearance that we are not making attempts to rectify the situation. \n\nWe consider these loan modification actions to be nothing short of predatory, fraudulent and negligent given the process is tied to a federal program. Especially in light of the fact that the banking industry itself was bailed out by the federal government at a never before seen level of support. As a family, however, from the bank 's perspective, we are not to be afforded a similar opportunity to financially recover. \n\nNevertheless, we remain optimistic that a loan modification will obtained. Our primary request is that the process be fair and equitable and that by filing this complaint it will bring a sense balance to the situation. \n"
